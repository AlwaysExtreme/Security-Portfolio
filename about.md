My name is Mitchell Luke Tuck. I’m currently in my 2nd year of university studying a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Diploma of Information Technology Professional Practice, majoring in Networking & Cybersecurity. I have previously studied an Advanced Diploma of Network Security at the Australian Careers Business College where I excelled in my course not only coming first but also awarded student of the year for my efforts.

I have a deep passion for technology, security and helping people; with these three passions I’ve come to realise how important the Cyber Security industry is. We are in a world being rapidly digitalised, with a boom in black hat hacking and foreign enemy states using cyberspace as a method of attack, we’re falling behind in security at the cost of the end users.
