Brownie points for linking your research to the guest (TBA) presentation that will be held in the morning (10AM - 12PM).
Make sure to include examples.
Keep it high-level.


Your research is to be submitted individually to your sprint 3 submission. Be sure to include your reflection on your learning whilst linking it back to the SLOs. Do not forget your references, academic resources and artefacts.
In your reflection, make sure that your research is technical and low-level.
