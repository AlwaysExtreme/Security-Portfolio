# Portfolio Final Reflection
Over the past four weeks, I have gone from a beginner to a Boot2Root cabable Offensive Security Professional. During this intensive Summer Studio, I have developed numerous skills in project planning, communication, time management, physical security and IT based security particularly in Offensive Security.


# Subject Learning Outcomes
**Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset 2019**
## 1. Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem

**Engage with cybersecurity experts and other industry stakeholders to identify system vulnerabilities, their consequences and complexities.**


Engaged in conversation with Robert Mitchell a leading security industry expert who works for GitLab in their security team. An artefact I received from this conversation was Robs email address for future communications if ever we have a question. He mentioned that we should also read “Underground: Tales of Hacking, Madness and Obsession on the Electronic Frontier”. It was very beneficial having an industry expert come in and talk with the students as he answered all of our questions on the spot and made us think of more questions to ask. Further industry visits will be highly regarded.

Feedback I received was:

    I asked the question on the GitLab website, it states that GitLab has a 200% Faster DevOps Life-cycle, with this, what has been done to ensure the security aspect keeps up with such a fast life-cycle" he answered my question with "Automation and standardisation at all stages of the DevOps life-cycle (Continuous Innovation, Continuous Development (CI/CD).
    When coming across an unexpected result, dig into this issue, it could be a new vulnerability as something most likely had just broke, utilise wire shark/logs etc for further detailed analysis of these.
    Ensure to always maintain, monitor & respond to logs from IDS as this is always overlooked.
    RFCs = Standards running the internet.
    Some people have endless certifications and say they know about a certain software but they only know how it’s foundations and not how it functions and how to better it, i.e. Burp suite and pfSense, certifications are a start point, not an end-point.
    If you want a job in this day and age it's a must to talk to people, both in our fields and others, via meetups, private communications and Social networking such as LinkedIn.
    Approach interesting companies especially start-ups as they can sometimes be in hyper-growth and too busy to try searching for a security specialist to hire, or this aspect could have been over looked all together.
    Lesson to learn from the Art of war by Sun Tzu – Always be ready.
    Learn Grep commands to filter out the usual artefacts to find the unusual in logs etc.
    Learn the OWASP top 10.
    Learn SANS ASP Checklist – top down.

With everything that I took home from this presentation I was able to open up a new chapter of research and methodology for focusing on my future security career. This presentation was invaluable to me especially at such an early stage in my career.









## 2. Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem

**Use problem solving and creative methodologies to identify security vulnerabilities
    Document steps taken to overcome problems adding to the weekly sprint submissions e.g. a personal blog entry**
    
A team member dropped out just before project one's presentation day, so we had to have an emergency meeting for our group so that we were able to ensure we could mitigate the issue best we could and deliver on our side even though being down a member. Our group did a really good job in the circumstances we had.

I began building my website by utilising a static website generator, this was something I had never done before. With this it required a lot of research for me to understand how everything worked. with this I learned the foundations of a static website and how it functions and was able to build a successful website.

I further gained knowledge in how to work under pressure in a team environment from unexpected events effectively. With this, it greatly increased my confidence in knowing that when future situations like these arise I know I can overcome these obstacles.    
    







## 3. Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design

**Research security vulnerabilities and exploits and be able to apply this research to evaluate the security state of a system to document attack vectors and their mitigations.**

Presented a group research project to the class and participated in technical class discussions. Did in-depth research to understand the deeper aspects of the 2011 RSA Security breach and what was involved to pull off such a feat. I explained the issue in depth and brought up interesting terminology such as heap spraying.

Began the configuration of my Kali Linux box Artefact 3: Kali Setup Also utilised VMware snapshots to ensure any potential errors in the future could be reversible. Artefact 4: Kali Backup

With this, I further understood what was required of me to succeed in this studio.







## 4. Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills

**Communicate key impacts and consequences of security vulnerabilities and potential threats with various audiences.
    Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills through active participation on the studio’s Microsoft Teams chat, amongst peers in the classroom and through your online weekly sprint submissions (not Wordpress, Wix , Weebly or similar, be creative).
Present weekly findings either in groups or as a stand ups to discuss the milestones, challenges, and what roadblocks are encountered.**


Identified through a group presentation how social engineering has a huge impact on the way malware is able to spread. Pulled off the group presentation regarding the issue with our team member leaving by effectively communicating over Slack, Microsoft Teams & Facebook messenger.

We did a good job of communicating to pull our team through the presentation. With this we identified that communication is very important, it is one of the foundations of what makes a true leader and a team successful.


## 5. Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation

**Utilise weekly feedback forms to aid personal and team growth, areas for improvement, team dynamic, and any discoveries made during this evaluation
    Reflect on the tools and resources required to facilitate self-study and discovery in order to solve security problems**

From my one on one with Larry, I was able to gain very beneficial information on how I could improve and given details on topics and resources I could benefit from by both Larry & Darshil.

They informed me that I went quite well in my presentation and for me to keep getting more technical but also having the ability to simplify it so that those without the technical knowledge such as executives in other fields and their employees in the work place, and the general public, can understand what is being said.

With this, I learned how to further improve on my presentation and communication skills, such as increasing strategic eye contact, increased expression with both relevant hand gestures and tone of voice.

# Conclusion
**articulating how your learning journey has enabled you to meet or redefine your objectives**

The journey entailed from week one to now has been a non-stop cuntinous and intensive experience, it has enabled me to meet all 5 of the SLOs, each in depth, and has made me achieve multiple things that I had been planning to do but never had the time or the right environment to do so. Utilising the Agile project management methodolgy I have been able to achieve these in a very effective and timely manner far exceeding my expectations for this course.

From the learning contract I built in week one through to the additional goalsd I had been setting each week, I have been able to achieve all of these and then and then some.





**✦A final reflective statement that synthesises your learning journey. Each subject learning objective is addressed in the final reflective statement indicating the ways in which the learning was achieved.
✦Reflectively curated, relevant artefacts that form a coherent and cumulative substantiation of claims of achievement of the subject’s five Subject Learning Objectives**
