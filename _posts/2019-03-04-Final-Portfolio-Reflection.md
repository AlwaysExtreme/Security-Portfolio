# Final Reflection Introduction
Over the past four weeks, I have gone from a beginner to a Boot2Root cabable Offensive Security Professional. During this intensive Summer Studio, I have developed numerous skills in project planning, communication, time management, physical security and IT based security particularly in Offensive Security.


# Subject Learning Outcomes
**Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset 2019**
## 1. Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem

Engaged in conversation with Robert Mitchell a leading security industry expert who works for GitLab in their security team. An artefact I received from this conversation was Robs email address for future communications if ever we have a question. He mentioned that we should also read “Underground: Tales of Hacking, Madness and Obsession on the Electronic Frontier”. It was very beneficial having an industry expert come in and talk with the students as he answered all of our questions on the spot and made us think of more questions to ask. Further industry visits will be highly regarded.

Viren Khatri - Manager, Simon Baeg – Analyst/Pentesting andNathan Jones – Cyber Intelligence Analyst from Deloitte where I was able to gain an in depth view of how enterprise level security teams function and specifically learned about Special Operation Command Centrees and Red Teams. Luke Fuehrer was able to educate me further on his role as a Red Teamer and was there throughout the weeks to answer any question I had to throw at him. And lastly, Ruben, who was able to educat me on Reverse Engineering and what steps are required to continue on building this skill to a level hopefully at his skill level one day.

With everything that I took home from these engagements with stakeholders, I was able to open up a new chapter of research and methodology for focusing on my future security career. These presentations were invaluable to me especially at such an early stage in my career.


## 2. Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem

During week one, a team member dropped out just before group project one's presentation day, so we had to have an emergency meeting for our group so that we were able to ensure we could mitigate the issue best we could and deliver on our side even though being down a member. Our group did a really good job in the circumstances we had.

I began building my website by utilising a static website generator, this was something I had never done before. With this it required a lot of research for me to understand how everything worked. with this I learned the foundations of a static website and how it functions and was able to build a successful website.

Working with the issues that were brought about after the website migration, I was able to narrow down and identify the root cause of the website being down and how to get it back up and running, which in this case was a misconfiguration of the SSL Certificate, and so a temporary reduction in website security (Always HTTPS off/DNSSEC) brought back up the website.

Also when coming into the technical practical events, It was rather quite a challenge to apply and learn new skills that were required to achieve my goal for the objective given. Doing Hack the Box where I had to figure out exploits after enumerating and doing Vulnerability scans was by far the hardest yet most rewarding. Even though it took many hours and late into the night, I was able to achieve root access to the box within the same day of setting that goal which was a massive achievement in itself.

I further gained knowledge in how to work under pressure in a team environment from unexpected events effectively. With this, it greatly increased my confidence in knowing that when future situations like these arise I know I can overcome these obstacles.    
 

## 3. Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design

Presented a group research project to the class and participated in technical class discussions. Did in-depth research to understand the deeper aspects of the 2011 RSA Security breach and what was involved to pull off such a feat. I explained the issue in depth and brought up interesting terminology such as heap spraying as well as identifying the vulnerability to be CVE-2011-0609 and how it had eventuated from a failure withing ActionScript3 AVM2 verification logic thus resulting in unsafe Just-In-Time (JIT) code being executed.

Looked into the Heartbleed vulnerability and utilised it to access password and username details from memory thus being able to access the affected device. I was able to show that not only do systems require encryption, but in the case of Heartbleed, it  is extremely important to keep up to date with the latest patches for your system as it was able to retrieve plaintext data from data encrypted by the OpenSSL library.

Presented a group reasearch project on John the Ripper and it's ability to crack weak passwords with ease, this showed that it is extremely important to implement strong passwords using a combination of case sensitive letters, numbers and symbols (!, #, %, #, $, etc.). It's also important to never use the same password once, if one password becomes breached, all your other accounts would thus be vulnerable also.


## 4. Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills

**Communicate key impacts and consequences of security vulnerabilities and potential threats with various audiences.
    Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills through active participation on the studio’s Microsoft Teams chat, amongst peers in the classroom and through your online weekly sprint submissions (not Wordpress, Wix , Weebly or similar, be creative).
Present weekly findings either in groups or as a stand ups to discuss the milestones, challenges, and what roadblocks are encountered.**


Identified through a group presentation how social engineering has a huge impact on the way malware is able to spread, pulling it off even with our team member leaving by effectively communicating over Slack and Microsoft Teams.

We did a good job of communicating to pull our team through the presentation. With this we identified that communication is very important, it is one of the foundations of what makes a true leader and a team successful.


## 5. Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation

**Utilise weekly feedback forms to aid personal and team growth, areas for improvement, team dynamic, and any discoveries made during this evaluation
    Reflect on the tools and resources required to facilitate self-study and discovery in order to solve security problems**

From my one on one with Larry, I was able to gain very beneficial information on how I could improve and given details on topics and resources I could benefit from by both Larry & Darshil.

They informed me that I went quite well in my presentation and for me to keep getting more technical but also having the ability to simplify it so that those without the technical knowledge such as executives in other fields and their employees in the work place, and the general public, can understand what is being said.

With this, I learned how to further improve on my presentation and communication skills, such as increasing strategic eye contact, increased expression with both relevant hand gestures and tone of voice.

# Conclusion


<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/screenshots/Mid-Presentation.JPG" width="300" /></div>


The journey entailed from week one to now has been a non-stop cuntinous and intensive experience, it has enabled me to meet all 5 of the SLOs, each in depth, and has made me achieve multiple things that I had been planning to do but never had the time or the right environment to do so. Utilising the Agile project management methodolgy I have been able to achieve these in a very effective and timely manner far exceeding my expectations for this course.

I have enagaged with some of Australias best Industry professionals such as Robert Mitchell, Viren Khatri, Simon Baeg, Nathan Jones, Luke Fuehrer and Ruben, with them answering some of the questions I've had for a while but could only be answered by someone in the field. I have been able to apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem multiple times throughout the Studio notably Website SSL Certificate errors, Team member dropping out and time management modifications I was constantly doind to optimise my time due to me working permanent part-time outside of this Summer Studio.

Applied technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design on multiple occasions most notably during the Reverse Engineering challenges and the Hack the Box Curling machine. Communicated with individuals in Scrum sessions, worked with team members on projects, presented to the class and during my last week to Industry Professionals and the general public and Academic staff. During this process I've been able to do critical self and peer assessments during individiual and group presentations, scrum sessions and participation in Capture The Flags (CTFs).

From the learning contract I built in week one through to the additional goals I had been setting each week, I have been able to achieve and exceed all of these while meeting all 5 SLOs. With my true test in week four cracking into my very first Hack the Box machine, I have proven that I have come a long way since week one, this in itself has boosted my confidence more then I could have ever imagined and has assured me that I am heading in the correct career direction.
