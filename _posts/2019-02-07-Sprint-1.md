INTRODUCTION

My name is Mitchell Luke Tuck. I’m currently in my 2nd year of university studying a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Diploma of Information Technology Professional Practice, majoring in Networking & Cybersecurity. I have previously studied an Advanced Diploma of Network Security at the Australian Careers Business College where I excelled in my course not only coming first, but also gaining student of the year for my efforts. I have a deep passion for technology, security and helping people, with these three passions I’ve come to realise how important the Cyber Security industry is as while we’re in a world being rapidily digitalised, we’re falling behind in the security of the end users and can't keep up with these advancements in technology.


LEARNING CONTRACT

Throughout university I have been eager to learn as much about Cyber Security as I can, with this, when I saw the Summer Studio “Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset”, I was rather quite excited. Through this studio, I hope to further advance my theoretical knowledge in the security industry while also getting hands on with practical experiences.
Key objectives I’d like to achieve are:
•	Further research exploit methods
•	?
•	?
•	?
