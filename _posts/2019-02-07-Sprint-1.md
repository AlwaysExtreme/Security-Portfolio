# H2 INTRODUCTION

My name is Mitchell Luke Tuck. I’m currently in my 2nd year of university studying a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Diploma of Information Technology Professional Practice, majoring in Networking & Cybersecurity. I have previously studied an Advanced Diploma of Network Security at the Australian Careers Business College where I excelled in my course not only coming first, but also gaining student of the year for my efforts. I have a deep passion for technology, security and helping people, with these three passions I’ve come to realise how important the Cyber Security industry is as while we’re in a world being rapidily digitalised, we’re falling behind in the security of the end users and can't keep up with these advancements in technology.


# H2 LEARNING CONTRACT

Throughout university I have been eager to learn as much about Cyber Security as I can, with this, when I saw the Summer Studio “Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset”, I was rather quite excited. Through this studio, I hope to further advance my theoretical knowledge in the security industry while also getting hands on with practical experiences.
Key objectives I’d like to achieve are:
# ⋅⋅* Further research exploit methods
# ⋅⋅*	?
# ⋅⋅*	?
# ⋅⋅*	?

The Student Learning Outcome (SLOs) for this course are:

# ..1 Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem.

# ..2 Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.

# ..3 Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs.

# ..4 Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills.

# ..5 Conduct critical self, peer, and group review and performance evaluation


# H1 GROUP REFLECTION

Was able to develop a presentation on the 2011 RSA Security Breach and present it to the class, tutors and Security Industry expert Rob Mitchell.
Artefact 1:
 ???????????????????????????
(Power Point Presentation)

The group ran into some rough waters when one of our team members decided that it would be best if she were to drop out of the subject before census date, this was due to her having no technical background in this field and she thought best to leave early. With this though, our now group of three were able to evenly distribute the workload and achieve a successful presentation on time.
Artefact 2:
 ?????????????????
(Ex-Team members message)

Learned that Zero-Day-Attacks are a serious threat, how vulnerable Adobe Flash is, that a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) such as Poison Ivy has the ability to be a really good offensive tool especially with its feature rich design. Also, that humans still remain the weakest link for security due to their ability to be socially engineered into infecting their own devices such as the RSA Security employee who’d clicked the infected .xls document in the spearfishing email.

Need to learn more about heap spraying, was in which we can identify new zero-day attacks, how to identify computers infected with malware and how to best mitigate any further damages, with the thought of what can we have done to prevent this issue and any further attacks in the future.

As students we need to further dive into these issues and their terminology while also getting hands on so that we can develop a deeper understanding of what goes into such attacks and start our minds thinking how these attacks could be stopped.

For staff, they have done a fantastic job this far, but next they need to ensure that we are following along while delving into the technical side of computer security over the coming week.
