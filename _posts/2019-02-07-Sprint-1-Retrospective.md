# INTRODUCTION

[Portrait Picture](https://github.com/AlwaysExtreme/root9b/blob/master/Portfolio-Photo1.jpg)

My name is **Mitchell Luke Tuck**. I’m currently in my **2nd year** of university studying a **Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Diploma of Information Technology Professional Practice, majoring in Networking & Cybersecurity**. I have previously studied an **Advanced Diploma of Network Security** at the Australian Careers Business College where I excelled in my course not only coming first but also awarded student of the year for my efforts. 

I have a deep passion for technology, security and helping people; with these three passions I’ve come to realise how important the Cyber Security industry is. We are in a world being rapidly digitalised, with a boom in black hat hacking and foreign enemy states using cyberspace as a method of attack, we’re falling behind in security at the cost of the end users.

# LEARNING CONTRACT

Throughout university, I have been eager to learn as much about **Cyber Security** as I can, with this, when I saw the **41151 Summer Studio B “Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset” 2019**, I was rather quite excited. Through this studio, I hope to further advance my theoretical knowledge in the security industry while also getting hands-on with practical experiences.

**Key objectives I’d like to achieve are:**

  > Further research exploit methods
  
  > Start doing Capture The Flags (CTFs)
  
  > Start hunting Bug Bounties
  
  > Learn relevant documentation such as ISO 27001, SANS ASP Checklist etc
  
  > Start building my skills towards achieving certifications such as CISSP, OSCP, GSEC & Security +.


**The Student Learning Outcome (SLOs) for this course are:**

  1) Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem.

  2) Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.

  3) Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs.

  4) Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills.

  5) Conduct critical self, peer, and group review and performance evaluation.

# GROUP REFLECTION

My group and I were able to develop a presentation on the 2011 RSA Security Breach and present it to the class, tutors and Security Industry expert **Robert Mitchell** from the **GitLab Security Team**. [Artefact 1: Group Presentation](https://github.com/AlwaysExtreme/root9b/blob/master/screenshots/2019-02-08_01_21_12-Window.png)

Our group ran into some rough waters when one of our team members decided that it would be best if they were to drop out of the subject before the census date, this was due to them not having enough technical background to succeed in the studio and thought best to leave early. With this though, we were able to present as a group of three after evenly re-distributing the workload between ourselves, and were able to achieve a successful presentation on time. [Artefact 2: Member Leaving](https://github.com/AlwaysExtreme/root9b/blob/master/screenshots/Member-Leaving.png)

Through this presentation, we learned how **Zero-Day-Attacks** are a serious threat, how vulnerable Adobe Flash is, that a **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** such as **Poison Ivy** has the ability to be a really good offensive tool especially with its feature-rich design. We also found that **human error is the weakest link** for security due to their lack of knowledge of the threat space and threat vectors and because of this can easily be socially engineered into infecting their own devices such as that of the RSA Security employee who’d clicked the infected .xls document in the spearfishing email.

I'd like to learn more about heap spraying, how to identify new zero-day attacks and methods to report them, how to identify computers infected with malware and how to best mitigate any further damages, while thinking of how we can prevent similar issues in the future.

As students, we need to further dive into these issues and their terminology while also getting hands on so that we can develop a deeper understanding of what goes into such attacks and start our minds thinking how these attacks function, and how they could be stopped. For staff, they have done a fantastic job this far, but next, they need to ensure that we are following along while delving into the technical side of computer security over the coming weeks.

# SPRINT REFLECTION

**Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)**

### 1) Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem.
Engaged in conversation with **Robert Mitchell** a leading security industry expert who works for **GitLab** in their security team. An artefact I received from this conversation was Robs email address for future communications if ever we have a question. He mentioned that we should also read **“Underground: Tales of Hacking, Madness and Obsession on the Electronic Frontier”**. It was very beneficial having an industry expert come in and talk with the students as he answered all of our questions on the spot and made us think of more questions to ask. Further industry visits will be highly regarded.

**Feedback I received was:**
-	I asked the question on the GitLab website, it states that GitLab has a 200% Faster DevOps Life-cycle, with this, what has been done to ensure the security aspect keeps up with such a fast life-cycle" he answered my question with "Automation and standardisation at all stages of the DevOps life-cycle (Continuous Innovation, Continuous Development (CI/CD).
-	When coming across an unexpected result, dig into this issue, it could be a new vulnerability as something most likely had just broke, utilise wire shark/logs etc for further detailed analysis of these.
-	Ensure to always maintain, monitor & respond to logs from IDS as this is always overlooked.
-	RFCs = Standards running the internet.
-	Some people have endless certifications and say they know about a certain software but they only know how it’s foundations and not how it functions and how to better it, i.e. Burp suite and pfSense, certifications are a start point, not an end-point.
-	If you want a job in this day and age it's a must to talk to people, both in our fields and others, via meetups, private communications and Social networking such as LinkedIn.
-	Approach interesting companies especially start-ups as they can sometimes be in hyper-growth and too busy to try searching for a security specialist to hire, or this aspect could have been over looked all together.
-	Lesson to learn from the Art of war by Sun Tzu – Always be ready.
-	Learn Grep commands to filter out the usual artefacts to find the unusual in logs etc.
-	Learn the OWASP top 10.
-	Learn SANS ASP Checklist – top down.

With everything that I took home from this presentation I was able to open up a new chapter of research and methodology for focusing on my future security career. This presentation was invaluable to me especially at such an early stage in my career.

### 2) Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.
A team member dropped out just before project one's presentation day, so we had to have an emergency meeting for our group so that we were able to ensure we could mitigate the issue best we could and deliver on our side even though being down a member. Our group did a really good job in the circumstances we had.

I began building my website by utilising a static website generator, this was something I had never done before. With this it required a lot of research for me to understand how everything worked. with this I learned the foundations of a static website and how it functions and was able to build a successful website.

I further gained knowledge in how to work under pressure in a team environment from unexpected events effectively. With this, it greatly increased my confidence in knowing that when future situations like these arise I know I can overcome these obstacles.

### 3) Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs.
Presented a group research project to the class and participated in technical class discussions. Did in-depth research to understand the deeper aspects of the **2011 RSA Security breach** and what was involved to pull off such a feat. I explained the issue in depth and brought up interesting terminology such as heap spraying.

Began the configuration of my Kali Linux box [Artefact 3: Kali Setup](https://github.com/AlwaysExtreme/root9b/blob/master/screenshots/2019-02-08%2014_06_45-kali-linux-2018.4-vbox-amd64%20-%20VMware%20Workstation.png)
Also utilised VMware snapshots to ensure any potential errors in the future could be reversible. [Artefact 4: Kali Backup](https://github.com/AlwaysExtreme/root9b/blob/master/screenshots/Creating_VM_snapshot.png)

With this, I further understood what was required of me to succeed in this studio.

### 4) Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills.
Identified through a group presentation how social engineering has a huge impact on the way malware is able to spread. Pulled off the group presentation regarding the issue with our team member leaving by effectively communicating over **Slack, Microsoft Teams & Facebook messenger**.

We did a good job of communicating to pull our team through the presentation. With this we identified that communication is very important, it is one of the foundations of what makes a true leader and a team successful.

### 5) Conduct critical self, peer, and group review and performance evaluation
From my one on one with Larry, I was able to gain very beneficial information on how I could improve and given details on topics and resources I could benefit from by both **Larry & Darshil**.

They informed me that I went quite well in my presentation and for me to keep getting more technical but also having the ability to simplify it so that those without the technical knowledge such as executives in other fields and their employees in the work place, and the general public, can understand what is being said.

With this, I learned how to further improve on my presentation and communication skills, such as increasing strategic eye contact, increased expression with both relevant hand gestures and tone of voice.

# CONCLUSION

In the past week, I have learned more than I could have hoped for regarding offensive security that it has actually surprised me. Utilising the **Agile project planning methodology**, I've been able to reach all my goals in an effective and timely manner.

In the coming weeks I hope to further deepen my theoretical and practical knowledge while achieving more of my key objectives mentioned in the aforementioned **"Learning Contract"**, of this Summer Studio - **"Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset"**.
