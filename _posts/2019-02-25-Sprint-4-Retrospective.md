# SPRINT 4 - Reverse Engineering and Portfolio Presentation
This week will be a journey dedicated to going from Boot to Root, in other words, breaking into vulnerable machines.

## Monday
  - Ruben presented the concepts of Reverse Engineering to us,
  - I was successfully able to complete the first two challeneges as seen here: [Reverse Engineering Challenge](root9b/screenshots/ReverseEngineeringChallenge - Solution.pdf)
  - Spent a few hours tonight doing further modifications to my website to get it loading faster.
      
## Tuesday
  - Set up my account for HTB
    - How to set up HTB
    - Pass HTB’s initial login challenge
    - Create an account
    - Go to “Access” tab
    - Download connection pack and save to a local directory of your choice
    - Navigate to this directory via Terminal and run the “openvpn (YourFileName).ovpn”
    - Once this is run go back to HTB and where the HTB Lab Access Details are, click the small refresh button (DO NOT TOUCH REGENERATE!).
    - You can now penetrate the machines.
  - Further investigated HTB's features and how everything functions
